## User Experience (UX)

### Design

- #### Colors

  The design colors used in the "Country Challenge" game create a visually appealing. The primary color scheme features a soft and warm background color (#f5cac2) with dark heading text color (#303179), this contrast enhances readability. The color-coded feedback for correct and incorrect guesses (green, pink, and gray) provides clear visual cues, helping players understand their progress. Additionally, the dark mode feature offers an alternative color scheme (#303179 background and #f5cac2 text) for a unique experience.

- #### Icons

  The navigation area in the "Country Challenge" game is enhanced with well-chosen design icons, adding both functionality and visual appeal. Three icons represent distinct sections: the gear icon represents the "Settings" section, the circle-info icon represents information section, and the chart-simple icon represents the "Statistics" section. Icons provide a user-friendly way for players to access essential game information, customize settings, and view their progress and statistics.

![Oops Messages](https://github.com/AmeenNoor/country-challenge/blob/main/assets/features/oops-message.png)

8. Play Again Functionality: Users can easily restart the game by clicking the "Play Again" button in the respective win or lose message window.

![Play Again Functionality](https://github.com/AmeenNoor/country-challenge/blob/main/assets/features/play-again-functionality.png)

8. Responsive Design: The website appears to be designed with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing and functionality across different devices and screen sizes.

### Future Features

1. API Auto Generate Word: Instead of using a static WordList, a dynamic API can be integrated into the game to automatically generate country names as the secret word for each round. This would add variety and ensure that players get a unique challenge with each attempt.

2. API Word Validation: An API that checks if the guessed word is a valid country name in the first place can enhance the game's integrity. It would prevent players from entering random or incorrect words, providing them with immediate feedback if their guess is not a valid country name.

3. Difficulty Levels: Adding a Difficulty Level feature in the settings section would allow users to choose the level of challenge they prefer.

4. Custom Word Length: Implementing a "Custom Word Length" feature would offer players the ability to choose the length of the country name they want to guess. Rather than being restricted to a fixed 5-letter word.

### Fixing Bugs

- #### Validation Bug
  
  1. Home Page:
  The errors in the HTML code were fixed by adjusting the nesting of elements. The inappropriate placement of `<h2>` and `<p>` tags inside `<span>` elements was rectified. Proper closing of `<div>` elements and `<span>` elements was ensured, and comment syntax issues were addressed. These corrections eliminated the errors and resulted in error-free HTML code.

  ![Home Page Bug Fixed](https://github.com/AmeenNoor/country-challenge/blob/main/assets/testing/bug-fixed-home-page.png)

### Open Bugs

The "Country Challenge" code does not currently validate user input for valid words/countries, potentially accepting incorrect entries. To improve this, an API should be integrated in the future to verify whether the player's guessed word/country is real or not. If an invalid entry is detected, the game should prompt the player to provide a valid word/country for a better user experience.
